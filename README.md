# Optimal Strassen

*Justin Gonzalez*

Strassen's divide and conquer algorithm for n by n matrix multiplication is asymptotically faster than the traditional O(n^3) algorithm. However, for small values of n, the traditional algorithm is actually faster. The goal of this project is to approximate the value of n for which Strassen's algorithm becomes faster and create an algorithm that optimally switches between the traditional O(n^3) algorithm and Strassen's algorithm.
